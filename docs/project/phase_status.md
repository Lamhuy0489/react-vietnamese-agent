# Phase Status

- Current stage: **Phase 2 — clean benchmark v1 authoring infrastructure**
- Setup owner: Lâm Quang Huy
- Last updated: 2026-09-05

## Setup acceptance

- [x] Repository structure and operational docs created.
- [x] Python packaging, lint, typing, and test configuration created.
- [x] Credential paths excluded from Git.
- [x] Four repository-scoped Codex skills created.
- [x] Official Kaggle CLI skill installed and verified.
- [x] GitHub remote created and initial branch pushed.
- [x] Collaborator invitation sent to `minhb5d` with write access.
- [ ] `minhb5d` accepts the GitHub invitation and confirms clone access
  (deferred by the project owner; not a Phase 1 blocker).

## Phase 0 handoff

- [x] Research contract accepted by the project owner.
- [x] Four previously ambiguous design decisions frozen.
- [x] Phase 1 authorized on 2026-09-05.

Phase 1 may proceed on synthetic smoke data while collaborator acceptance is
pending. Held-out benchmark data must not be created or accessed in this phase.

## Phase 1 progress

- [x] Five shared contracts and A0 configuration frozen.
- [x] Backend-neutral runtime, strict parser, broker, logger, and eight tools.
- [x] Synthetic environment and 20 smoke tasks (10 Huy / 10 Minh).
- [x] Local Replay run: 20/20 success, 0 crash, 8/8 tool coverage.
- [x] Local Dummy run: 20/20 terminal states, 0 crash.
- [x] Unit/integration suite: 35 tests passing; package coverage 89%.
- [x] Minh cross-review deferred by explicit owner decision.
- [x] Real-model Kaggle run: 20/20 terminal, 0 crash, artifacts audited.
- [x] Trace audit: 262 schema-valid events and valid tool event ordering.
- [x] Credential-value artifact scan: 0 matches.
- [x] Frozen run manifest and artifact SHA-256 values recorded.

Phase 1 was **accepted on 2026-09-05**. The low A0 semantic score (3/20) is a
recorded limitation, not a completion blocker.

## Phase 2 progress

- [x] Phase 2 explicitly authorized on 2026-09-05.
- [x] 250 total / 150 Dev / 100 Test and category quotas retained.
- [x] Same-machine workflow recorded; peer review replaced by automated QA and
  owner acceptance without fabricated reviewer metadata.
- [ ] Clean task/ground-truth/review schemas frozen.
- [ ] Frozen synthetic environment built and validated.
- [ ] Reviewed 250-task pool completed.
- [ ] Group-wise 150/100 split created and held-out Test sealed.
- [ ] Dev-only pilot completed without Test access.
- [ ] Phase 2 acceptance checks and frozen manifest complete.

Held-out Test does not exist yet and must not be created before pool QA passes.
