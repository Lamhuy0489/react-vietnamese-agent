# Decision Log

## 2026-09-05 — Initial operational contract

- Use the existing Word document as approved scope and `docs/` as the concise
  implementation contract.
- Use three backbones for RQ1, one fixed backbone for RQ2/RQ3 comparisons.
- Treat A0–A6 as cumulative defense levels.
- Split attack data by canonical family (40 Dev / 30 Test) before variants.
- Select the 50 robustness canonicals from clean held-out Test before sealing.
- Store repository skills in `.agents/skills` per current Codex discovery.

Exact model identities and collaborator account remain configuration decisions
and are not inferred here.

## 2026-09-05 — Repository and execution accounts

- GitHub source of truth: private repository
  `Lamhuy0489/react-vietnamese-agent`.
- Repository-local Git author: `Lamhuy0489 <lamquanghuy1234@gmail.com>`.
- Kaggle CLI smoke authentication uses the existing local credential for
  `lamhuy8904`; credential files remain ignored and outside Git history.
- Teammate GitHub username and collaborator permission are still pending.
